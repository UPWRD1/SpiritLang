# SpiritLang
Spirit is a lightweight, general purpose programming language written in python.


The Lexer, Parser, and interpreter are from CodePulse's tutorial. 
Strings_with_arrows.py is from CodePulse as well.

I love pull requests! If you want to contribute, please do.



While not intended to be completely functional, Spirit is a fully fleged programming languge, with first class functions, powerful one-liners, variables, lists, and more!

----------------------------

Spirit's syntax is easy to use, and verbose, which makes it easy to read, write, and understand, even for a beginner.
The syntax is inspired by BASIC, Python, and HTML. The popularity of these languages makes Spirit easy to learn.
